    <p>A Spicy set of Delicious chicken breast</p>

    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This little masterpiece as i love to call it,
        is a really Delicious dish to consume
        and it is solely made from CHICKEN....YUMMY!!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Butter and Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt ,Kosher salt to be precise.</li>
        <li>Seasonings</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps Involved</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Brine:</strong>
            <p>To brine chicken, simply fill a big bowl with lukewarm (not hot) water.
                Stir in a handful of salt until it mostly dissolves. Then add your chicken breasts and 
                let them sit in the saltwater to brine for at least 15 minutes. 
                If you are doing this in advance, you can cover and refrigerate the bowl
                of chicken and saltwater for up to 6 hours. But you don’t want to let the chicken brine for much longer than that.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Brush:</strong>
            <p>Brush your chicken breasts with melted butter. Or at least,
                I highly recommend using butter. It adds great flavor and helps give a nice golden crust on the outside. 
                But if you’d rather use olive oil (or another favorite cooking oil), feel free.

                Brush the breasts liberally on both sides to prevent the chicken from sticking to the pan, and also to help the seasonings stick. 
                Then place the chicken breasts in a large baking dish or roasting pan.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rub:</strong>
            <p>If you’re really wanting to keep things simple, you can simply sprinkle some salt and pepper onto
                 the chicken breasts. But again, chicken will pick up the 
                flavor of whatever seasonings you add. So even if you’re making a simple dish that calls for
                 “plain” chicken breasts, I highly recommend the simple
                chicken seasoning recipe I have included below that
                 includes salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika</p> 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Roast:</strong>
            <p>Depending on the thickness of your chicken breasts, roasting chicken at 450°F should require a cooking time of about 
                15-18 minutes (depending on the thickness/size of your chicken breasts). 
                It’s speedy and it’s easy. But mostly I love it because cooking at high 
                heat quickly develops a nice crispier “crust” on the outside of the breasts,
                which also helps to lock in those juices and keep the oven roasted chicken perfectly
                 tender on the inside. It’s the best of both worlds</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Rest:</strong>
            <p>This one is a non-negotiable. You must, must let your beautifully baked chicken breasts 
                rest before cutting into them — a tip which applies to cooking any meat, really.
                If you cut in right away, you will lose all of the amazing juices and some of the
                tenderness that we’re going for. But if you give your freshly baked chicken breasts a brief rest,
                it will finish cooking and lock in all of those delicious juices, 
                resulting in the most tender and juicy and delicious baked chicken.</p>
